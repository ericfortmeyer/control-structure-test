# Control Structure Test

### Which method of iteration is faster?

The tests are being used to compare the speed of a set of control structures
available to PHP.  The functions are tasked with determining if all characters
of a string are alphanumeric.  Results are in nanoseconds.

```bash
# do this...
./run_test_print_results
# or...
./run_test_save_results
```
